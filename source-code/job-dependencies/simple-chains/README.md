# Simple chains

Example of a simple workflow that consists of a
* preprocessing step,
* a processing step that requires multiple cores, and
* a postprocessing step.


## What is it?

1. `preprocess.py`: Python script for the preprocessing step.  It generates
a file with a given number of 2D-points.
1. `process.py`: Python script for the processing step.  It reads the file
generated by the preprocessing step, and computes the distance between all
pairs of points.  It uses multiple cores to do so.
1. `postprocess.py`: Python script for the postprocessing step.  It reads
the file generated by the processing step, and computes the distribution of
the distances.
1. `workflow.slurm`: Slurm script to run all the steps in a single job.
1. `preprocess.slurm`: Slurm script to run the preprocessing step.
1. `process.slurm`: Slurm script to run the processing step.
1. `postprocess.slurm`: Slurm script to run the postprocessing step.
1. `submit_workflow.sh`: Bash script to submit the workflow to the Slurm
scheduler, setting dependencies between the steps.
