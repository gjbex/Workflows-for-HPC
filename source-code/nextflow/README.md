# NextFlow

NextFlow is a workflow system that is mainly popular among bioinformaticians
but that can be applied to any domain. It is designed to be portable,
reproducible, and scalable.  It can run processes of a workflow as Slurm
jobs.


## What is it?

1. `simple-chains`: simple example of a workflow with three processes,
    each processing the output of the previous one.  One process also
    requires a conda environment.
