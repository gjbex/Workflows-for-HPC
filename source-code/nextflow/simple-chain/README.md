# Simple chain

Example of a simple workflow that consists of a

* preprocessing step,
* a processing step that requires multiple cores, and
* a postprocessing step.


## What is it?

1. `preprocess.py`: Python script for the preprocessing step.  It generates a
   file with a given number of 2D-points.
1. `process.py`: Python script for the processing step.  It reads the file
   generated by the preprocessing step, and computes the distance between all
   pairs of points.  It uses multiple cores to do so.
1. `postprocess.py`: Python script for the postprocessing step.  It reads the
   file generated by the processing step, and computes the distribution of the
   distances.
1. `workflow.nf`: NextFlow script defining the workflow.
1. `nextflow.config`: minimal NextFlow configuration file to enable conda
   environments.
1. `conda_environment.yml`: conda environment file to create the environment
   required by the `Process` step of the workflow.
1. `conda_init.sh`: Bash script to initialize the shell for conda use.
   **Note:** this script is only sourced when running the workflow with the
   `slurm` executor, i.e., with configuration file `nextflow_slurm.config`.


## How to use it?

To run the workflow locally,
```bash
$ nextflow run workflow.nf
```

To run the workflow on a Slurm cluster,
```bash
$ nextflow run workflow.nf -C nextflow_slurm.config
```
