# Snakemake

Snakemake is a workflow management system that aims to reduce the complexity of
creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution environment,
together with a clean and modern specification language in python style.
Snakemake workflows are essentially Python scripts extended by declarative code
to define rules. Rules describe how to create output files from input files.


## What is it?

1. `text-data`: simple Snakemake workflow that generates text data.
1. `image-data`: Snakemake workflow that generates image data, contains a rule
   that uses wildcards.
